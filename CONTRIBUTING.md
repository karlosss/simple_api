# Contributing

All contributions are done in form of pull requests - fork the repository, do the work, and then
create a pull request.

In case of implementing a new feature, make sure to add testcases for it.

The tests are run automatically for each pull request using a CI/CD pipeline. To run the test
locally, you can use `run_tests.sh`. Refer to the contents of the script for more information.

When making a pull request, make sure that the commits on the branch all make sense and the
history of the branch is (at least somewhat) clean. If this is not the case, 
`git rebase --interactive` is your friend.

Thank you very much for your contributions!
